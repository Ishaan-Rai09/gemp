# Audio File Placeholder

This directory should contain a demo.mp3 file for the website's audio demo functionality.

Since we can't create actual audio files through this interface, you'll need to add your own audio file named `demo.mp3` to this directory.

Alternatively, you can modify the Hero.tsx component to remove the audio playback feature or point to an external audio URL.
